		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>I'm a full stack web developer from the Philadelphia area. I build dynamic, responsive websites using Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, and more.</p>
		<p>I initially graduated college a B.A. in Film and Television Studies from the University of Vermont in Burlington, VT. After graduating, I found a job at a news station,starting as a Production Assistant on the morning new show. I was able to see everything involved in putting on a live broadcast and I learned how to work under pressure and tight deadlines, and how to work and succeed as part of a team. Before long, I had mastered all the tasks a P.A. is assigned, and managed to work my way up to Director of the morning show. I found myself in charge of the entire production team, with the success of our broadcast depending on my ability to work quickly and remain calm under pressure, and to get the best out of every member of my team.</p>
		<p>Being a small local television station, we were unfortunately sold to a company with no desire to run a barely-profitable news station, which proceeded to close the station. I spent some time looking for a new tv position but soon realized my heart was no longer in it and I did not want to continue in the television business. Having always been good with technology, effectively acting as tech support for my entire family and having been repairing and upgrading my own devices for years, I decided to start down the path towards a tech career.</p>
		<p>Being unable to return to school full-time, and to see if I would enjoy a career doing it, I began learning web development, teaching myself and taking a coding bootcamp for a bit of a jump start. I have been thoroughly enjoying the technical and creative challenges that come with this career path. Today, I am going back to school part-time working towards my Computer Science degree, as I now regret not doing the first time around, as well as studying for my CompTIA A+ and Network+ certifications. I am hoping to find and entry level developer, quality assurance, or tech support position so that I can gain some professional experience while continuing to fill any knowledge gaps by furthering my formal education.</p>
		<p>On a personal note, aside from my interest in technology, I spend my free time playing hockey, snowboarding, hiking, poorly playing the guitar, and trying to stop my elderly dog from walking into things. As you may have guessed, I love finding new films and tv series to enjoy.</p>
